# Bounties

We’ve launched our bounty program! Check the [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fyFSkiyfSGVeO8uW97gS7-gIt9qTbGIpYaMcHcjPF4Q/edit?usp=sharing) to see how you can contribute and the reward values for each task.

# Stereo Cameras

we’re excited to add [Looper](https://looper-robotics.com/?utm_source=blogger&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=booking&promo=uIwjGxmJ) as a first-class supported camera, alongside RealSense.

Looper is special because it provides built-in depth and visual–inertial odometry (VIO), enabling many new possibilities for perception and navigation.

# [v0.3] What's Changed
## 🚀 Features
- **IMU–Visual Fusion in Perception Node**
  
    Integrates IMU–visual fusion to significantly improve pitch-angle accuracy.
  
    This enhancement boosts overall robustness and enables reliable navigation across more robot platforms, especially those sensitive to pitch drift.

- **Resilient Mapping Pipeline**

    Upgraded map-building logic to gracefully handle message loss, improving stability in real-world communication conditions.
  
    Paired with a redesigned visualization module, developers can now observe the map-building process incrementally, making debugging and tuning far more intuitive.

- **Unified Model Training for Perception + Planning**
  
    We have begun training a single neural model that jointly supports both perception and planning tasks, paving the way for tighter integration and future performance gains. [(TinyBEV)](https://github.com/uniflexai/tinybev)

## 🔧 Improvements
- **Enhanced C++ CI & Code Quality**
  
    The CI pipeline now includes:
    * clang-tidy static analysis
    * ASAN (Address Sanitizer) detection
      
    These additions ensure higher reliability, cleaner code, and safer memory usage across the C++ stack.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

Dozens of internal fixes and refinements were merged this cycle, improving system stability, consistency, and developer experience.

# [v0.2] What's Changed
## 🚀 Features
- **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) Map Representation**  
  Provides high-quality visualization and an intuitive map editor, making it easy to inspect map details and place target POIs with precision.

- **ESDF-based Obstacle Avoidance**  
  Enables more human-like navigation. Robots not only avoid obstacles but also keep a safe distance, improving path quality.

- **Localization Benchmark**  
  Adds a benchmark for map-based localization, allowing clear and quantitative evaluation of improvements across versions.

- **CUDA Graph Optimization**  
  Reduces inference overhead and achieves >20Hz on Jetson Nano, lowering latency for real-time closed-loop navigation.

## 🔧 Improvements
- **Simplified First-Time Setup**  
  The `postStartCommand` command in the dev container now auto-generates platform-specific models, reducing errors and making setup more user-friendly.

- **Expanded CI Testing**  
  Broader continuous integration coverage ensures higher build stability and code quality.

- **Map Storage with KV Database**  
  Maps are now stored using `shelve`, resulting in shorter code and better performance.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Over **50 pull requests** merged since the last release, delivering numerous fixes and stability improvements.

- **`tinynav/core/`**  
  Core Python modules for perception, mapping, planning, and control:
  - `perception_node.py` – Processes sensor data for localization and perception.
  - `map_node.py` – Builds and maintains the environment map.
  - `planning_node.py` – Computes paths and trajectories using map and perception data.
  - `control_node.py` – Sends control commands to actuate the robot.
  - Supporting modules:
    - `driver_node.py`, `math_utils.py`, `models_trt.py`, `stereo_engine.py`.

- **`tinynav/cpp/`**  
  C++ backend components and bindings for performance-critical operations.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **git** and **git-lfs** (for cloning and handling large files)
- **Docker**

**Platform-specific requirements:**
- For **x86_64** (PC): [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) (for GPU support)
- For **Jetson Orin**: [JetPack SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) version 6.2 or higher

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Check the environment**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UniflexAI/tinynav.git
   cd tinynav
   bash scripts/check_env.sh
   ```
   Follow the instructions to fix any environment issues until you see:
   ```bash
   ✅ Docker is installed.
   ✅ Docker daemon is running and accessible.
   ✅ NVIDIA runtime is available in Docker.
   ✅ Git LFS is installed.
   ✅ devcontainer.json patched for your x86 platform.
   ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code**  
   - Launch VS Code and open the `tinynav` folder.  
   - Install the **Dev Containers** extension if prompted.  
   - Reopen the folder inside the container.  

3. **Run the example**  
   Once inside the container, start the demo:
   ```bash
   bash /tinynav/scripts/run_rosbag_examples.sh
   ```
   You should see an **RViz** window displaying the live planning process:

   </p>

## 📜 What `run_rosbag_examples.sh` Does

The script automates the entire demo workflow:

1. **Plays dataset**  
   Streams a recorded dataset from [this ROS bag](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniflexAI/rosbag2_go2_exposure_1k).

2. **Runs TinyNav pipeline**  
   - **`perception_node.py`** → Performs localization and builds the local map.  
   - **`planning_node.py`** → Computes the robot’s optimal path.  
   - **RViz** → Visualizes the robot’s state and planned trajectory in real time.  

---

✨ With these steps, you’ll have the full TinyNav system up and running in minutes.
# Developer Guide

## Using Dev Containers

TinyNav supports [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) for a consistent and reproducible development experience.

### Using VS Code

1. Open the `tinynav` folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Ensure the **Dev Containers** extension is installed.
3. VS Code will automatically start the container and open a terminal inside it.

### Using the Dev Container CLI

If you prefer the command line:

#### Recommended: install a newer Node.js/npm with nvm first

Some systems ship with an older npm. We recommend installing a newer Node.js/npm via `nvm` before installing the Dev Containers CLI:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

Then install and use the Dev Containers CLI:

```bash
# Install the Dev Containers CLI
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli

# Start the Dev Container
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .

# Open a shell inside the container
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash
```

---

## First-Time Setup (Inside the Dev Container)

After entering the development container, set up the Python environment:

```bash
uv venv --system-site-packages
uv sync
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

### Optional Dependencies

Depending on your robot platform or map representation, install the corresponding extras:

```bash
# Unitree GO2 robot support
uv sync --extra unitree

# LeKiwi robot support
uv sync --extra lekiwi

# 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) map support
uv sync --extra 3dgs
```

You can combine multiple extras in one command:

```bash
uv sync --extra unitree --extra 3dgs
```

# Next Steps
- [ ] **High Optimization NN models**:
      Support real-time perception processing at >= 30fps.
- [ ] **Map module enhancement**:
      Improve consistency and accuracy for mapping and localization.
- [ ] **End-To-End trajectories planning**:
      Deliver robust and safe trajectories with integrated semantic information.
