# TinyNav Mapping Benchmark

This benchmark module evaluates the accuracy and consistency of TinyNav's mapping and localization capabilities.

## Benchmark Pipeline 1: Cross-Map Localization Accuracy

This benchmark evaluates how well TinyNav can map and localize using two datasets by a self-consistency approach. For best results, ensure test datasets contain enough trajectory overlap.

### Process Overview

1. **Map A Creation**: Run mapping on ROS bag A to create map A
2. **Localization in Map A**: Use map A to localize poses from ROS bag B (100 selected images)
3. **Map B Creation**: Run mapping on ROS bag B to create map B (ground truth)
4. **Pose Extraction**: Extract ground truth poses from map B for the same 100 timestamps
5. **Transformation Estimation**: Use RANSAC to estimate rigid transformation between map A and map B coordinate systems
6. **Accuracy Evaluation**: Compute localization accuracy with multiple precision thresholds

### Image Selection Strategy

From each ROS bag, 100 images are selected for evaluation:
- Remove front and back 5% of trajectory when robot is likely stationary
- Select images evenly spaced in time from the remaining 90% of trajectory
- This ensures evaluation on dynamic, representative motion data

### Evaluation Metrics

Localization accuracy is measured with three precision categories:
- **High Precision**: Within 5cm translation / 2° rotation
- **Medium Precision**: Within 10cm translation / 5° rotation
- **Low Precision**: Within 30cm translation / 10° rotation

Results are reported as percentage of the 100 test images meeting each precision threshold.

### Coordinate System Alignment

Since map A and map B are built independently, they exist in different coordinate systems. The benchmark:
1. Uses pose pairs (localization result from map A, ground truth from map B) for the same 100 timestamps
2. Applies RANSAC to estimate the optimal rigid transformation between coordinate systems
3. Transforms all map A localization results to map B coordinate system for comparison
4. Treats map B poses as ground truth for evaluation

### Usage

```bash
# Run benchmark between two ROS bags
uv run python tool/benchmark/benchmark_mapping.py --bag_a path/to/bag_a.db3 --bag_b path/to/bag_b.db3 --output_dir results/

# Example with provided test data
uv run python tool/benchmark/benchmark_mapping.py \
    --bag_a my_bag_a \
    --bag_b my_bag_b \
    --output_dir benchmark_results/
```

#### Command Line Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--bag_a` | Required | Path to ROS bag A (for creating reference map) |
| `--bag_b` | Required | Path to ROS bag B (for localization and ground truth) |
| `--output_dir` | `output/benchmark_results` | Output directory for results |
| `--num_images` | `100` | Number of evaluation samples |
| `--rate` | `1.0` | Playback rate for ROS bags (e.g., 2.0 for 2x speed) |
| `--timeout` | `60` | Timeout for each mapping process (seconds) |
| `--verbose_timer` | - | Enable verbose timer output for all nodes |
| `--no_verbose_timer` | - | Disable verbose timer output (cleaner logs) |

#### Timer Output Control

By default, the benchmark runs in quiet mode with minimal timer output for cleaner logs. You can control the verbosity:

```bash
# Default behavior - quiet mode (recommended for production)
uv run python tool/benchmark/benchmark_mapping.py --bag_a bag_a --bag_b bag_b

# Enable verbose timing for debugging/development
uv run python tool/benchmark/benchmark_mapping.py --bag_a bag_a --bag_b bag_b --verbose_timer

# Explicit quiet mode (same as default)
uv run python tool/benchmark/benchmark_mapping.py --bag_a bag_a --bag_b bag_b --no_verbose_timer
```

**Note**: Verbose timer mode shows detailed timing information from perception, mapping, and localization nodes, which can be helpful for performance analysis but produces significantly more log output.

### Output

The benchmark generates:
- **Summary Report**: Overall accuracy statistics and performance metrics
- **Detailed Results**: Per-image localization errors and success/failure analysis
- **Transformation Matrix**: Estimated rigid transformation between coordinate systems
- **Visualization Data**: Trajectory plots and error distributions (if applicable)


## Benchmark Pipeline 2: Cross-Map Self-Consistency Evaluation (VLAD)

`map_retrieval_self_consistency.py` evaluates DINOv2 patch VLAD retrieval (the descriptor TinyNav actually ships and uses at runtime, see `tinynav/core/vlad.py`) across two independently-built maps **without needing a known coordinate transform between them**. Map B keyframes query Map A; the script fits its own SE(2) transform from the retrieval's own top-1 matches via RANSAC, then measures how consistent the rest of the top-k candidates are with that fitted transform.

It always reads `vlad_descriptors.db` from both maps — there is no descriptor-backend switch, matching the fact that TinyNav's map-building and relocalization code (`build_map_node.py` / `map_node.py`) always uses VLAD with no other option (see the PR's "Notes" section).

### Why self-consistency instead of a known transform

Map A and Map B are each built independently (separate mapping runs), so their coordinate frames don't line up. There is no ready-made ground-truth transform between them, and getting one (e.g. manual alignment, a fixed marker) is extra setup. Fitting the transform from the retrieval's own top-1 matches avoids that setup — the trade-off is that the fitted transform is only as good as the retrieval being evaluated, so treat the resulting metrics as a **self-consistency signal**, not external ground-truth accuracy.

### Test dataset

- `metrics.csv`: recall / precision / IoU for each top-K × distance-threshold combination.
- `per_query_results.jsonl`: per-query retrieved candidates and the fitted-transform residual.

Recommended primary score: `top1_inlier_ratio["0.5m"]` from `summary.json`.

### Example results

Run against the GT/day/night bags above, comparing VLAD (this branch) against the DINOv2 global-embedding baseline from main. See the `feat(vlad): ...` PR description for the full write-up, including why the three VLAD training variants are grouped together (their differences aren't a reliable signal, see "Why batched, not strict single-point" there).

#### Day: `map_day -> map_gt`

| Method | Fit Inlier@1m | Top1 Mean | Top1 Median | Top1 P90 | R@1 0.5m | R@10 0.5m | IoU@10 0.5m |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| DINOv2 global | 92.03% | 0.433m | 0.229m | 0.839m | 78.80% | 97.44% | 0.3325 |
| DINOv2 patch VLAD (original, in-memory) | 98.80% | 0.270m | 0.197m | 0.505m | 89.62% | 99.10% | 0.4161 |
| + disk-persisted online k-means (strict single-point) | 99.10% | 0.232m | 0.180m | 0.413m | 93.08% | 99.25% | 0.4364 |

#### Night: `map_night -> map_gt`

| Method | Fit Inlier@1m | Top1 Mean | Top1 Median | Top1 P90 | R@1 0.5m | R@10 0.5m | IoU@10 0.5m |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| DINOv2 global | 29.31% | 8.698m | 8.099m | 22.559m | 23.34% | 35.96% | 0.0996 |
| DINOv2 patch VLAD (original, in-memory) | 35.14% | 6.885m | 7.421m | 16.955m | 31.48% | 39.08% | 0.1422 |
| + disk-persisted online k-means (strict single-point) | 35.28% | 6.568m | 7.271m | 16.579m | 31.75% | 37.04% | 0.1515 |
| + disk-persisted online k-means (batched, **shipped**) | 36.64% | 6.626m | 7.382m | 16.701m | 31.21% | 39.89% | 0.1407 |

All three DINOv2 patch VLAD variants clearly outperform the DINOv2 global baseline on both day and night.

## Benchmark Pipeline 3: Keyframe Relocalization Accuracy

`map_fusion_benchmark.py` evaluates keyframe relocalization poses against an
eval mapping run transformed into the GT map frame. This is the simpler
map-to-map self-consistency benchmark:

1. Use `--map-gt` (existing map) or `--bag-gt` (build from bag).
2. Use `--map-eval` (existing map) or `--bag-eval` (build from bag and replay for localization).
3. When `--bag-eval` is used, replay the bag with TinyNav against `map_gt`, saving relocalization poses.
4. Fit `T_map_eval_to_gt` from paired eval timestamps.
5. Compare:

```text
relocalization_pose_in_map_gt  vs  T_map_eval_to_gt * map_eval_keyframe_pose
```

This treats the eval mapping trajectory as the reference trajectory after it is
aligned into `map_gt`. It is still a pseudo-ground-truth / self-consistency
signal, but it matches the operational question: "when the eval bag runs against
the GT map, how far is the relocalized keyframe pose from the aligned eval map
trajectory?"

When building a map from a bag, the benchmark automatically detects the source:

- If the bag contains `/camera/camera/vio_image`, it starts `tool/looper_bridge_node.py`.
- Otherwise, it starts `tinynav/core/perception_node.py`.

### Usage

Both GT and eval sources accept either a map directory or a bag (mutually exclusive):

- `--map-gt` / `--bag-gt`: existing GT map or bag to build from.
- `--map-eval` / `--bag-eval`: existing eval map or bag to build from.

When `--bag-eval` is provided, the tool builds `map_eval` and replays the bag
against `map_gt` to produce relocalization poses. When `--map-eval` is provided
instead, map build and localization are skipped and the existing
`relocalization_poses.npy` under `--work-dir` is reused. The same applies to
`--map-gt` vs `--bag-gt` for the GT side.

Run the full pipeline from two bags:

```bash
uv run python tool/benchmark/map_fusion_benchmark.py \
  --bag-gt /tinynav/tinynav_db/rosbags/bag_gt \
  --bag-eval /tinynav/tinynav_db/rosbags/bag_eval \
  --output-root /tinynav/output
```

Use an existing GT map, build the eval map from a bag:

```bash
uv run python tool/benchmark/map_fusion_benchmark.py \
  --map-gt /tinynav/tinynav_db/maps/map_gt \
  --bag-eval /tinynav/tinynav_db/rosbags/bag_eval \
  --output-root /tinynav/output
```

Reuse existing maps and only regenerate the metrics/report (requires existing
localization results in `--work-dir`):

```bash
uv run python tool/benchmark/map_fusion_benchmark.py \
  --map-gt /tinynav/output/benchmark_work/20260802_120000_map_gt_benchmark_work/map_gt \
  --map-eval /tinynav/output/benchmark_work/20260802_120000_map_gt_benchmark_work/map_eval \
  --output-dir /tinynav/output/20260802_120000_map_gt_benchmark \
  --work-dir /tinynav/output/benchmark_work/20260802_120000_map_gt_benchmark_work
```

If `--output-dir` is not provided, the tool creates a timestamped folder under
`--output-root`:

```text
YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS_<gt_map_or_bag_name>_benchmark/
```

Generated maps and localization scratch data are written outside the report
folder, under `--work-root` by default:

```text
<output-root>/benchmark_work/YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS_<gt_map_or_bag_name>_benchmark_work/
```

This keeps the report folder lightweight and easy to copy or share.

### Output

The report folder contains only lightweight artifacts:

- `index.html`: visual report with inputs, metrics, trajectory plots, error curves,
  `T_map_eval_to_gt`, and largest-error samples.
- `metrics.json`: machine-readable summary.
- `per_sample_errors.json`: per-timestamp translation/rotation error.
- `T_map_eval_to_gt.npy`: fitted transform.
- `sampled_timestamps_ns.txt`: sampled timestamps.
- `trajectory_xy.png`, `trajectory_xz.png`, `trajectory_yz.png`: top-down and side projections of `map_eval*T` vs relocalization pose.
- `translation_rotation_error.png`: error over time.
- `xyz_error.png`: per-axis position residual over time.
- `retrieval_diagnostics/`: per-sample match images and `retrieval_diagnostics.json` (unless `--disable-retrieval-diagnostics`).

Recommended first-look metrics:

- median / p90 translation error
- ratio below `0.10m`, `0.20m`, `0.30m`, `0.50m`
- trajectory plot shape consistency

## Future Benchmark Pipelines

Additional benchmark pipelines will be added to evaluate:
- Long-term map consistency and drift
- Multi-session mapping accuracy
- Computational performance and resource usage
- Robustness to different lighting and environmental conditions
